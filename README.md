# COVID-19 Analysis 
Hello everyone!\
In this repository, we try to tackle three major problems resulting from COVID-19\
1)Identify if age or biological sex impacts viral load as measured by qPCR.\
2)Investigate the impacts of seasonal change on viral load as measured by qPCR.\
3)Determine the effects of seasonal change on SARS-CoV-2 infection.\
The inspiration of these questions were based off this paper: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.01.20205096v2.full
